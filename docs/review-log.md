# Review log

Findings from `fundamentals-reviewer` gates that were accepted or deferred
(fixed findings live in git history). One line of justification each.

## Gate 1 — milestone 1 scaffold (`2a24111`) — PASS

Fixed in follow-up: default log filter (core IDs at info), grouping by
`sender_id` + message IDs, timestamps instead of preformatted strings,
grapheme/bidi-safe initials, unused deps, deterministic abort test,
redundant theme test removed.

Deferred:
- **Virtualized lists + long-message cap** → milestone 4 (chat list,
  `uniform_list`) and milestone 5 (messages, `MessageScroller` + body cap with
  a regression test). Only mock data until then.
- **Keyboard actions/focus** → milestone 2, which is exactly this scope.
- **Manual theme choice overwritten by system appearance; not persisted** →
  milestone 2 (persisted System/Light/Dark preference).
- **Unwired nav buttons, `details_open` never toggled** → milestone 2 actions.
- **Log-filter test** → not added; it would restate the constant. Revisit when
  log output tests land (security regression layer).
